# docker-images

This repository contains customized Docker images, built on a regular schedule using cache to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

## Add a new image

1. Create a new directory.
2. Add all the necessary files to that new directory (`Dockerfile` + any dependencies).
3. Add the name of the directory to the `stages.yml` file. If the docker image depends on an existing one, add it to the next stage otherwise add it to stage-1.

## Remove an existing image

1. Make sure that no other docker files depends on it.
2. Remove the directory.
3. Remove the directory name from the `stages.yml` file.
